# Analysis Service

The Analysis Web-Service is token based, so for every analysis request a TOKEN is associated to the result. From this moment on, the results can be accessed via the API “token” method in order to retrieve more detailed information. Taking advantage of the token produced during every analysis, it is possible to link back to the PathwayBrowser and browse the results overlaid on either the pathways overview or a selected pathway.
